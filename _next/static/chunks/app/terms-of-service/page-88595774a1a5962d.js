Mayfest Productions believes providing more context is essential given this year's theme, Camp Dillo. The theme of summer camps often invokes racist Native American tropes and mascots, while also creating a colonial dichotomy between “nature” vs. “civilization” that stems from Native American genocide and white supremacy. Mayfest Productions acknowledges that summer camps often serve as a site of Indigenous appropriation, and commits to rejecting discriminatory tropes and imagery.

Pre-colonization, the Indigenous communities in the area had established a vast network of trails and portages, or places to carry and drag boats from one water system to another, and had a robust trading network. By 1833, most Indigenous communities were displaced from the region after they were pressured to sign a series of coercive treaties. The 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which was taken as a surrender to Indigenous peoples' claims to Chicagoland, was signed before the creation of Northwestern's lakefill in 1962-1964. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi laid claim to this land east of Michigan Avenue created by landfill in the 1980s and thereafter. For the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa—the Council of Three Fires—Lake Michigan is not just a body of water but a vital cultural, spiritual, and economic resource. Native peoples have historically depended on the Great Lakes for transportation, sustenance, trade, and ceremonial purposes, viewing them as sacred spaces with significant spiritual importance. The creation of the lakefill altered these traditional and sacred spaces. This act changed the natural shoreline and disrupted the ecological balance of the area.

On the Northwestern campus alone, the John Evans Center is named after one of Northwestern's founders John Evans, who had direct involvement in the Sand Creek Massacre, the mass murder of Cheyenne and Arapaho people. According to a report conducted by the University of Denver, Evans's actions as the territorial governor of Colorado, such as violence-inciting proclamations and neglect of treaty-negotiation duties, set the conditions for a massacre to occur. Northwestern continues to develop on stolen land; The Pokagon Band of the Potawatomi Indians Tribal Historic Preservation Office wrote to the City of Evanston and Northwestern over concerns of the new Ryan Field construction and its disturbance of ancestral burials and archaeologically sensitive sites, as seen on Evanston's Land Use Commission's website.
