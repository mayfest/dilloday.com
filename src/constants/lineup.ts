          "Chicago-born, Grammy Award-winning rapper Lupe Fiasco gained national attention with his 2006 album Food & Liquor, which helped cement a new wave of Chicago rappers in the national conversation. Lupe's writing was informed by his experiences growing up on the West Side, and this debut album changed the course of Chicago hip-hop forever. The independent rapper is pegged as one of the most gifted lyricists and visionaries to grace the mic. Since his rise to fame, Lupe has released eight acclaimed studio albums. These albums have netted 3 platinum singles, 3 RIAA Gold Certifications, 12 Grammy nominations and one Grammy Award in 2008 for his infectious single, 'Daydreamin,' feat Jill Scott. There is no doubt that Lupe Fiasco is one of the most gifted lyricists and profound artists in hip-hop today. Lupe has continued to push boundaries and deliver compelling narratives, releasing hit songs such as 'Superstar' featuring Matthew Santos, 3x Platinum 'The Show Goes On', and 'Battle Scars' with Guy Sebastian.",

This album opener blew fans and new listeners away with its Brazilian Funk Beat, Japanese Folk, and Punk Rock blend along with the popular songs 'Princess Going Digital' and 'Reckless & Sweet.' Amaarae's biggest song to date is SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY with Kali Uchis. The smash hit made for the dancefloor has racked up over 400 million streams on Spotify.",

    "The younger and melodic half of Southern hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd, however, is quick to deny any association to being two different people and instead opts for a more complex, manifold, but unified version of himself. Nowhere does this ring truer than in Swae's versatile music and sound that is undeniably and utterly Swae. Born in Inglewood, California as Khalif Malik Ibn Shaman Brown, the singer cites Texas as a focal point in his beginnings in music at the age of 11 or so, where he began to seriously pursue his musical interests. Outside of school and familial extracurriculars, Swae would experiment with production, recording software, and learn how to mix audio. Swae, has made a name for himself outside of his duo work, showcasing himself as a force to be reckoned with both within and beyond the hip hop world, with tracks such as 20x Platinum 'Sunflower' with Post Malone, Diamond Certified 'Unforgettable' with French Montana, showing off his singing chops and his impressive list of writing credits including Beyoncé's 'Formation' and Travis Scott's Diamond certified 'Sicko Mode'. Swae's melodic repertoire, however, is not relegated exclusively to the r&b and hip-hop sphere as his crooning can also take on ballad form and mesh into a more electronica background as well—a complex Gemini in many ways.",
