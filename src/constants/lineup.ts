          'Born Milo Evans, nimino is one of the most exciting new names in electronic music. His 2024 breakout single, “I Only Smoke When I Drink,” blends warm analog synths with a soulful Rayana Jay sample. After teasing the track on social media, fan demand exploded, and the song soon charted on the UK Singles Chart and spent over 20 weeks on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Chart. It now boasts over 100 million Spotify streams and has been championed by industry heavyweights like Pete Tong, Diplo, and Danny Howard. I Only Smoke When I Drink is a standout from his upcoming EP, Creek, slated for release on Ninja Tune’s Counter Records—home to artists like ODESZA, Maribou State, and Roosevelt. The EP continues the journey of the “nimino character,” a visual symbol of his evolving soundscapes and creative imagination. Fresh off a sold-out North American headline tour in Fall 2024, nimino has played major festivals including Lightning in a Bottle and Leeds Fest, with upcoming appearances at even more global stages in 2025.',

        description:
          'Conceived by guitarist Henry Stoeher, drummer Teddy Matthews, and bassist Alex Leeds, Slow Pulp began as a college project centered at the University of Wisconsin. After releasing their first EP, EP1, in 2015, longtime collaborator and pseudo-member Emily Massey formally joined the band as guitarist and lead vocalist. From there, the band continued to develop their musical voice, specializing in ethereal indie rock by blending strings and vocals to bring their own unique flair to the “alt-country” sound. Their sophomore album, Yard, demonstrates a deeper understanding of the alt-country and indie genres — being hailed by Variety as one of the best rock albums of 2023. Their most popular track, “Falling Apart,” is a violin-backed indie comfort ballad that feels like a spring walk on the Lakefill. In January, the group released a deluxe version of Moveys, which includes five live song performances — a sneak peek of what’s to come for their Dillo Day performance.',

In 2024, they released “Light!” featuring Lil Nas X, marking Nas’s first-ever feature. Their subsequent albums, “#gigi” and “#mia” (short for Manic in America), showcases Skaiwater’s evolving sound and introspective lyricism. Now based in Los Angeles, Skaiwater continues to explore new musical territories and break boundaries in music. We are excited to welcome them to Dillo Day 2025!',
